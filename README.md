Health Insurance Price Prediction
This repository contains a Linear Regression Model built to predict health insurance charges based on various factors such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the health insurance charges a person might incur using a machine learning model. The dataset used contains demographic details and personal health information of individuals.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

Age: Age of the primary beneficiary
Sex: Gender of the beneficiary (male/female)
BMI: Body mass index
Children: Number of children/dependents covered by health insurance
Smoker: Whether the beneficiary is a smoker (yes/no)
Region: Geographic region (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)
Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance (target variable)
Model
A Linear Regression Model is used to predict the health insurance charges based on the above features.

Steps:
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values (if any)
Convert categorical data (sex, smoker, region) into numerical values using encoding techniques
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize relationships between features and the target variable
Check for correlations
Model Training:
Train the model using the Linear Regression algorithm
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared
Prediction:
Predict the charges based on new data inputs
